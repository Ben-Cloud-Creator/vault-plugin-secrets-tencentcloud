# TencentCloud Secrets Engine

The TencentCloud secrets engine dynamically generates TencentCloud user access tokens based on user
policies, or TencentCloud STS AssumeRole credentials based on CAM roles. This generally
makes working with TencentCloud easier, since it does not involve clicking on the web UI.
The TencentCloud user access tokens are time-based and are automatically revoked when the Vault
lease expires. STS AssumeRole credentials are short-lived, non-renewable, and expire on their own.

## Setup

Most secrets engines must be configured in advance before they can perform their
functions. These steps are usually completed by an operator or configuration
management tool.

1.  Enable the TencentCloud secrets engine:

    ```text
    $ vault secrets enable tencentcloud
    Success! Enabled the tencentcloud secrets engine at: tencentcloud/
    ```

    By default, the secret engine will mount at the name of the engine. To
    enable the secret engine at a different path, use the `-path` argument.

2.  [Create a CAM policy](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/35596)
    in TencentCloud that will be used for the access key you will give Vault. See "Example
    CAM Policy for Vault".

3.  [Create a user](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/13674) in TencentCloud
    with a name like "vault-user", and apply the new custom policy to this user.

4.  Create an access key for that user in TencentCloud, you can do this in [TencentCloud console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/policy).

5.  Configure that access key as the credentials that Vault will use to communicate with
    TencentCloud to generate credentials:

    ```text
    $ vault write tencentcloud/config \
        access_key=AKID47bb494148a5987f5b3cb55c024fc3155 \
        secret_key=2a6a141fabb55d53d6e785a1eee43c3c \
        region=ap-guangzhou
    ```

6.  Configure a CAM policy describing how credentials will be granted.

    To generate `cam_user` credential:

    ```text
    $ vault write tencentcloud/roles/cam_user_based \
        credential_type='user' \
        polices='{"version":"2.0","statement":[{"action":"name/sts:AssumeRole","effect":"allow","principal":{"service":["cloudaudit.cloud.tencent.com","cls.cloud.tencent.com"]}}]}'
    ```

    Or you can generate an `assumed_role` credential, for example:

    ```text
    $ vault write tencentcloud/roles/assumed_role_based \
        credential_type='assumed_role' \ 
        role_arn='qcs::cam::uin/12345678:role/4611686018427397919'
    ```

    Tencentcloud now support `cam_user` and `assumed_role` credential types, and will support more types in the
    future.

### Example CAM Policy for Vault

The credentials need sufficient permissions to issue secrets. The necessary permissions
vary based on the ways roles or users are configured.

This is an example CAM policy that would allow you to create credential.

```json
{
    "version": "2.0",
    "statement": [
        {
            "effect": "allow",
            "resource": "*",
            "action": [
                "name/cam:AddUser",
                "name/cam:AttachUserPolicy",
                "name/cam:CreateApiKey",
                "name/cam:CreatePolicy",
                "name/cam:DeleteApiKey",
                "name/cam:DeletePolicy",
                "name/cam:DeleteUser",
                "name/cam:DetachUserPolicy"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

However, the policy you use should only allow the actions and resources you actually need
for how your roles or users are configured.

If you want to create an `assumed_role` credential, you also need the following actions:

- `name/sts:AssumeRole`

## Usage

After the secret engine is configured, and a user/machine has a Vault token with
the proper permission, it can generate credentials.

1.  Generate a new user access key by reading from the `/creds` endpoint with the name
    of the role:

    ```text
    $ vault read tencentcloud/creds/cam_user_based
    Key                Value
    ---                -----
    lease_id           tencentcloud/creds/cam_user_based/coyaOue6nPBaqbhhOCqa8Nag
    lease_duration     1m40s
    lease_renewable    true
    access_key         AKIDavmzwcTB3f09G6OPow1qOffmfPt82YR3
    expiration         2020-08-24T12:42:32Z
    name               vault-token-user-2020-08-24-bp48uf3g
    secret_key         UhdttgT0IJ5astzoMcbJI6crpWswnUzD
    ```

    The `access_key` and `secret_key` returned are also known is an
    `"SecretId"`and `"SecretKey"`, in TencentCloud.

    Retrieving creds for a CAM role using `assumed_role` credential type will carry the additional
    fields of `expiration` and `security_token`, like so:

    ```text
    $ vault read tencentcloud/creds/assumed_role_based
    Key                Value
    ---                -----
    lease_id           tencentcloud/creds/assumed_role_based/fsmsqXSOUjbtK3c23JkVytFM
    lease_duration     10s
    lease_renewable    false
    access_key         AKIDTKjon74IhzxqnZxriQlFuf3UYbYgUmB2j87Ape92FTOguNHdZBAEeKp9LHkT-Mxy
    expiration         2020-08-24T04:49:43Z
    name               vault-token-ar-2020-08-24-0lg4x86s
